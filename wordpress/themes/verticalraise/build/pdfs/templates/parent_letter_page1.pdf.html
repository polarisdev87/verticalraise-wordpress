                <p>Hello Parents,</p>
                <p>We will be launching our Vertical Raise fundraising efforts in the coming days and wanted to
                    answer any questions you may have to gain participation. Vertical Raise is a social donation
                    campaign that has simplified the way teams, groups and schools raise money.
                    </p>
            </td>
            <td  style="width:20%">
                <h1 style="text-align: right; margin: 0; padding: 0;"><img class="alignright" src="[PICTURE_URL]" alt="logo" height="125" /></h1>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Participants will no longer sell any products, staff do not have to manage cash, or keep/distribute inventory.
        Fundraising is vital for the success of our program and we truly need to raise funds. Vertical
        Raise has a streamlined process that gives participants the ability to help raise money for a
        successful season. There have been thousands of programs who have had success utilizing this
        fundraiser and with your help, our fundraiser will be too.
    </p>

    <p>
        -All we ask, is that each parent/guardian help their participant(s) gather <span style="color: #f34343;">20 or more email
        addresses of their biggest supporters i.e. “Grandma, Grandpa, Aunts, Uncles, Family friends.”
        Then, emails will be sent to these potential donors where they can view the groups fundraiser
        page and decide if they want to donate.</span>If not, they can easily delete the email or help by sharing
        the fundraiser. We are confident there are many people eager to support your child and Vertical
        Raise’s platform affords them the opportunity to help if they choose. This Fundraiser will be a
        success if you help develop a quality list. Emails are only used for fundraising and will never be
        sold or redistributed.
