        <h2>How do I Create a Fundraiser?</h2>
        Creating a fundraiser is easy. 
        After you login, the system will take you to the &quot;My Account&quot; Page. 
        On that page, you can click the blue &quot;Create Fundraiser&quot; button. 
        Enter all the fundraiser details and click submit for approval. Fundraiser's are usually approved within 24 hours. 
        It's that simple.
